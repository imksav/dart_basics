1. Create a class named 'Student' with String variable 'name' and integer variable
'roll_no'. Assign the value of roll_no as '2' and that of name as "John" by creating
an object of the class Student.

2. Why is multiple inheritance not possible in dart? Explain with code.

3. Create an abstract class 'Parent' with a method 'message'. It has two subclasses
each having a method with the same name 'message' that prints "This is first
subclass" and "This is second subclass" respectively. Call the methods 'message'
by creating an object for each subclass.

4. An abstract class has a constructor which prints "This is constructor of abstract
class", an abstract method named 'a_method' and a non-abstract method which
prints "This is a normal method of abstract class". A class 'SubClass' inherits the
abstract class and has a method named 'a_method' which prints "This is abstract
method". Now create an object of 'SubClass' and call the abstract method and
the non-abstract method. (Analyze the result)

5. How do you create named constructors in Dart? Explain with the Dart code.

6. Explain the concept of interface in Dart with Dart Code.

7. Create a fixed size list in Dart. Insert 10 integer values inside the list. Retrieve
and print all the values.

8. Create a growable list that stores the name of your five friends. Retrieve the
elements of the list using a for loop and print them. Insert the new friend’s name
and print it again.Carry out the following operations in the list:
● Print first element of the list
● Print the last element of the list.
● Print all the elements between the 2nd and 4th index.

9. “Multiple inheritance in Dart can be achieved through interface in Dart.” Justify
this statement.

10.Discuss the importance of the following in the object oriented programming
paradigm.
● Inheritance:
● Abstract Class:
● Interface:
